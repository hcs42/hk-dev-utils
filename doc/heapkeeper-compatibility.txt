hk-dev-utils does not have releases and version numbers. This file describes
which hk-dev-utils version will work with which Heapkeeper version.

The released Heapkeeper versions have version numbers like v0.8. The
intermediate versions are named after the last release postfixed with a '+'
sign; so for example the intermediate versions between v0.8 and v0.9 are called
v0.8+. Since major refactorings are done right after a release, almost all
commits of v0.8+ will be more similar to v0.9 architecturally than to v0.8.

Compatbility table:
- Heapkeeper v0.8: a1fba4b..5942fc2
- Heapkeeper v0.8+: add6877..HEAD
